= Datatables Relation Management

This proof of concept tries to show you how to manage relation between two Datatables using two tables. One to display all the available records to be associated and the other one a table with the associated records.

== Testing the code

. Download the code of this repository
. Navigate to the `datatables-relation-management` folder.
. Open a new shell and execute the following command:
+
`mvn clean compile spring-boot:run`
. Open your favourite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
